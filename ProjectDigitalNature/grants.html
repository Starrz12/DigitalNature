<h3>Have an idea - How do you finance it?</h3>
<h3>You're likely here because you are working on a particular technology or have a specific idea and are looking for funding to advance it. Two key steps to find funding through the our programs:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Identify a participating agency or agencies interested in your topic area.</li>
        <li>Apply to a specific solicitation.</li>
    </ol>
<hr>
<h2>Identify a participating agency or agencies interested in your topic area.</h2>

<p>Different participating agencies fund different sectors and technology areas, so a first step is to see which agency or agencies fund projects relevant to you. Agencies also differ in how narrow or broadly they define their topic areas.</p>

<h3>Agencies with grants currently available:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Department of Agriculture</li>
    <li>Department of Defense</li>
    <li>Department of Health & Human Services</li>
    <li>Center for Disease Control & Prevention</li>
    <li>National Science Foundation</li>
</ol>
<p>Don't be discouraged if you don't pull up a topic that matches your interests - new topics are published periodically. You can search past topics of interest as well as what projects agencies have funded before.</p>

<h2>Apply to a specific solicitation.</h2>

<p>You must respond to a funding solicitation from a particular agency, because the programs do not accept “unsolicited” proposals. An agency funding solocitation document provides the rules and guidance on how to prepare a response, also called an application or a proposal. Solicitation documents include Proposal Preparation Instructions, Application and Submission guidance, and Evaluation criteria.</p>

<p>Some agencies have multiple solicitations throughout the year, while others may only have one solicitation release each year. Once you identify a relevant agency to target, learn more about that specific agency’s process.</p>

<p>For further information please contact departments directly.</p>
