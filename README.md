# DigitalNature
### I designed & built this web site featuring positive news stories about vaious world changing technologies. 
This project is made using HTML, CSS, & javascript (pulls the header info from a txt file for each page). DigitalNature has several pages, each with a header/ nav bar. <br>
The home page features thumbnails containing a picture and a short hook for a news article, as well as linking to the article mentioned. It also has an area dedicated to a featured article. <br>
There is also a mission page, a grant page, a page about funding for current research areas, and a contact form page with a survey. <br>
This is a fun project built from the heart. I believe in the importance of caring for earth + all in it and I believe that technological advances will pave the way to a positive future.
